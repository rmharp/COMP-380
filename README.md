## Perspectives on AI

In this project, we aim to explore the historical development and ethical implications of Artificial Intelligence (AI). Our objective is to provide a well-rounded view of AIâ€™s evolution, focusing on significant milestones and examining the moral and societal challenges associated with its advancement. Specifically, we will investigate issues such as ambiguous decision-making dilemmas, data privacy, misinformation, and human-AI interaction. Through interactive multimedia modules and an educational timeline, we hope to make complex ethical concerns accessible to a wide audience.

### Motivation

AI technology has inserted itself into many facets of society, including medicine, banking, and customer service. This comes with sizeable benefits to productivity and efficiency in these sectors. Despite the positives, AI comes with its own set of unresolved ethical issues like user privacy, intellectual property rights, and the potential replacement of human interactions. Still, AI usage continues to rise, proving the people care more about the conveniences than the consequences. With its continually growing influence, it is important to understand the past to guide use on how interact with AI in the future.

Our project will highlight why understanding these ethical considerations is essential for our audience. Researchers and engineers face genuine dilemmas when designing AI products, and these need to be understood by the public. This will empower them to define their own values and how they want that reflected in AI. Our goal is to encourage the audience to question their existing thoughts on AI and envision the changes they want to see in this evolving tech world.
